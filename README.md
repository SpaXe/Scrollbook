==========
This is where I will keep my code snippets, publically available for everyone to use, share, and comment.

All files will be cross-platform unless specified.  If I didn't provide both makefiles and VS project files, that's because I only developped on one machine and not both.  However one could easily copy the source code and compile elsewhere, with a few tweaks.  No proimses.
